Implement an evaluator for a very simple subset of Forth.

[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29)
is a stack-based programming language. Implement a very basic evaluator
for a small subset of Forth.

Your evaluator has to support the following words:

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (integer arithmetic)
- `DUP`, `DROP`, `SWAP`, `OVER` (stack manipulation)

Your evaluator also has to support defining new words using the
customary syntax: `: word-name definition ;`.

To keep things simple the only data type you need to support is signed
integers of at least 16 bits size.

You should use the following rules for the syntax: a number is a
sequence of one or more (ASCII) digits, a word is a sequence of one or
more letters, digits, symbols or punctuation that is not a number.
(Forth probably uses slightly different rules, but this is close
enough.)

Words are case-insensitive.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

Replace `<exercise-name>` with the name of the current exercise. E.g., to
test the Hello World exercise:

    jasmine hello-world.spec.js

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
